Disclaimer: I am not a programmer. I understand very little about arrays and fuctions, so I have to use unusal ways (I try) to accomplish the output I desire. 
            I am not the author of yad, here is his page on Github -- https://github.com/v1cont/yad.
            
Most all the programs I post in my yad repository have been tested on Debian 9+ based systems and work as described. 

First Program is: yad-paned-dnd-icon-browser.sh 

  This program uses the yad paned window and provides drag and drop top section where icons (also images and url's) can be dropped and a new smaller yad window will open to allow viewing of such file or website. I did a video here of it in action: https://rumble.com/embed/v1dzpcf
